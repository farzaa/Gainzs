# Gainzs

Built for the 24 hour ATT hackathon in Orlando.

Gainzs is an app that helps users find the most calorious food in their area for the lowest price using a couple of APIs and Maps. 

The app itself is currently in a partially broken state since by the end of the hackathon, perhaps 30 combined Red Bulls later, we were fk-ed up. Plus it was our first time doing Android!
